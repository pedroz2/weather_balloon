# weather_balloon
## Source code for TMP36's weather balloon payload.


This semester-long, 5 person project went from learning the basics of electrical wiring and soldering to launching a fully operational and to-specification atmospheric weather balloon. Our group elected to include two extra sensors, the MPU-9250 Gyroscope/Accelerometer, and the BMP-280 Barometer, in hopes of simultaneously measuring acceleration and altitude. With these two sensors, we were able to deduce wind shearing forces at different altitudes throughout Earthâ€™s atmosphere. The intended real-world application of this was to record the expected turbulence experienced by commercial airliners, and more specifically, how to avoid it. We used Altium to design a custom PCB and then had it printed to allow for a permanent board that would house our package sensors. To facilitate the use of our sensors, we created a C++ library to use them more efficiently - it won one of the class awards.
